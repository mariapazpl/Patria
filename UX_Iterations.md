# Record Log of Iterative Design Process of Patria Website
	
I completed the first prototype in Jan 2024. I gathered 3 friends and had them use the website. They provided the feedback below and I made changes accordingly. 	
	
## UX/UI Issue Identified &#8594; Changes Made
- Colour scheme not matching -> Settled on an earthy colour theme of green/brown/grey to be visually appealing
- Font size of title/text not in keeping with typographic hierarchy (important info was too small) -> Changed font size and scale to help guide the reader to the more important information
- Consistency with other similar websites -> I researched other food websites and made my layout somewhat similar, so that users will feel more comfortable immediately. The comments section I modeled after reddit/facebook, again for the same reason of consistency
- Navigation bar at the top was missing on some of the pages (i.e. the about page) -> kept the navigation bar accessible on all pages to promote user control 
- The red colour of the "delete" button was too bright and contrasted too much -> changed to maroon, still contrasted enough but did not appear too visually jarring
- Capitalization of "Patria" was inconsistent on some pages it was all caps and others it was not -> Changed it to all be "Patria" with only the first letter capitalized
- Some pages had too many words which increased clutter	-> decreased the wordiness of all the pages 
	
This log will be updated further with each iteration.
